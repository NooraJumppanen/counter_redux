# Counter App built with React and Redux

[![reduxcounter](https://github.com/NooraJumppanen/counter_redux/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NooraJumppanen/counter_redux/actions/workflows/main.yml)

The couter app has buttons to increment by 1 and 5, to decrement by 1 and 5, and to reset the counter to 0. If the counter shows 0, you can not decrement, but if not, you can decrement below 0 to negative numbers.

The background colour of the counter changes depending whether the number is odd or even.
